// Question 4:
// Write a JavaScript program to input sides of a triangle and 
// check whether a triangle is equilateral, scalene or isosceles triangle using if else.
// Properties of triangle:
/*
 ---> A triangle is said Equilateral Triangle, if all its sides are equal. 
      If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. 
      Then, the triangle is equilateral only if a == b == c.
 ---> A triangle is said Isosceles Triangle, if its two sides are equal. 
      If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. 
      Then, the triangle is isosceles if either a == b or a == c or b == c.
 ---> A triangle is said Scalene Triangle, if none of its sides are equal.
